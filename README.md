# mad_libs
A C++ program that mimics the beloved childhood game Mad Libs.  This program uses redirection to read words from a text file. It sorts
the words into adjectives, plural nouns, nouns, -ing verbs, and verbs. It then randomly places them in pre-programmed stories. Use source 
code and text file to run the code. Compile it first, and then to run it, put the executable name followed by 1, 2, or 3 and then the text 
file name. Example: a.out 1 &lt; word.txt
